# Introduction

*What is this lab about*

The intent of this lab is to introduce the user to Linux, the Linux command-line and some preparation to set the user on the path towards becoming a Linux command-line power user.

*What this lab is not about*

This is not a Linux Admin lab.  This lab does not replace the training available from Red Hat for Linux Admins.

*What is it about Linux?*

* Linux is _open source_
* Linux has a powerful and scriptable _command-line interface_ _(CLI)_
* Linux is _modular_

What is a Linux distribution?

* Distributions consist of a Linux kernel and supporting user space programs
* Distributions can be small and single-purpose or include thousands of open source programs
* Distributions must provide a means of installing and updating the distribution and it components
* The provider of the distribution must support that software and is typically part of the community developing the software

What are the differences between Fedora, RHEL, Centos and derivatives?
