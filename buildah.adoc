= Building with Buildah and Inspecting with Skopeo!


WARNING: You must complete the Podman unit before proceeding.

In this unit, we will get familiar with Buildah and Skopeo!

== Additional Reference Materials


NOTE: You are not required to reference any additional resources for these exercises.  This is informational only.

    * link:https://linuxhandbook.com/buildah-basics/[Getting Started with Buildah - Servesha]


== Connect to Host

There is a dedicated VM we will use for the container exercises.  From *workstation.example.com*, you should be able to ssh to *node3.example.com* as 'root' without any prompts for credentials.

.[root@workstation ~]#
----
ssh node3.example.com
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

.[root@node3]#
----
cheat-buildah-checkhost.sh
----

Now you are ready to begin your exercises with containers.

== Build an Image With Buildah

=== Web Site Version 2.0

In the previous lab on podman, we pulled down the httpd-24-rhel7 container and used an OCIFile to build a container. This was using buildah under the hood, but in this lab, we are going to use buildah directly. Let's get started by creating a working container based off of the httpd-24-rhel7 container:

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
buildah from core.example.com:5000/httpd-24-rhel7
----

.Your output should look like this
[source]
----
httpd-24-rhel7-working-container
----

This gives us the name of the "working container" and it's this container that we will modify with buildah.

Let's run:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
echo "Every time you run setenforce 0, you make Dan Walsh weep." > ./test.txt
buildah copy httpd-24-rhel7-working-container ./test.txt /var/www/html/
----

At this point, you have copied your local test.txt into the root of the webserver and you should see feedback similar to:

[source]
----
2254e08d2191091678d27aca275835cdce7d70cf120d66601750709105fdcd95
----

The above is equivalent to the following OCIFile (or Dockerfile):

[source]
----
FROM core.example.com:5000/httpd-24-rhel7
COPY ./test.txt /var/www/html/
----

So that's nice that we can do that with buildah, but let's look at the following example. Go ahead and mount the root filesystem of your container with:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
buildah mount httpd-24-rhel7-working-container
----

You should see output similar to:

[source]
----
/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/669b69de30cf8a39eafabccddb6a6e1db7d8d707e6a76c552518f4a8ed716cef/merged
----

Do the following (using the path returned by buildah for the cd command):

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
cd /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/669b69de30cf8a39eafabccddb6a6e1db7d8d707e6a76c552518f4a8ed716cef/merged
ls -lah /var/www/html
----

and you should see:

[source]
----
total 4.0K
drwxr-xr-x. 1 importantuser root 22 May  2 14:55 .
drwxr-xr-x. 1 importantuser root 18 Apr 19 02:13 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 importantuser root 58 May  2 14:54 test.txt
----

There is our test.txt! Let's add the following as /var/www/html/index.html:

[source]
----
<html>
<title>Stop Disabling SELinux</title>
<body>
<p>
Seriously, stop disabling SELinux. Learn how to use it before you blindly shut it off.
</p>
</body>
</html>
----

Once you have written that, you should be able to run:

.[root@node3 merged]#

[source]
----
ls -lahZ /var/www/html/
----

and see:

[source]
----
total 8.0K
drwxr-xr-x. 1 importantuser root unconfined_u:object_r:container_share_t:s0  40 May  2 15:01 .
drwxr-xr-x. 1 importantuser root unconfined_u:object_r:container_share_t:s0  18 Apr 19 02:13 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 root          root unconfined_u:object_r:container_share_t:s0 165 May  2 15:01 index.html
-rw-r--r--. 1 importantuser root unconfined_u:object_r:container_share_t:s0  58 May  2 14:54 test.txt
----

When you are done making direct changes to the root filesystem of your container, you can run:

.[root@node3 merged]#

[source]
----
cd /root
buildah unmount httpd-24-rhel7-working-container
----

You should see output similar to:

[source]
----
e918debcaabb5820997b1a4969fbd45284adc0a2869d1f22a1bce78f703ff3c6
----

Now at this point, we've used buildah to run commands similar to those in an OCIFile and to directly modify the root filesystem of the container. Let's go ahead and commit the working container to an actual container:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
buildah commit httpd-24-rhel7-working-container website2
----

You should see output similar to:

----

Let's look at our images:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
podman images
----

You should see:

[source]
----
REPOSITORY                             TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE

----

Now let's run that webserver:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
podman run -d -p 8080:8080 website2
----

Now let's test our new webserver:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/
----

returns:

[source]
----
<html>
<title>Stop Disabling SELinux</title>

<p>

t off.

----

and:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/test.txt
----

returns:

[source]
----
Every time you run setenforce 0, you make Dan Walsh weep.
----

As you can see, all of the changes we made with buildah are active and working in this new container image!

== Inspecting Images with Skopeo

Let's take a look at the website2:latest container that we just built:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
skopeo inspect containers-storage:localhost/website2:latest
----

This should show us output similar to:

[source]

----

and comparing the layers section, we can see that our container has 5 layers whereas the original container only has 4 layers. In this, we can tell that there are differences between these containers.

Pretty neat that we can look inside local containers, but what about containers that are in registries? Skopeo can inspect containers on remote registries without the need to pull the image locally. Let's give that a test:

.[root@node3 ~]#

[source]
----
skopeo inspect --tls-verify=false docker://core.example.com:5000/rhel7.5

The above allows us to look at our insecure registry's copy of RHEL 7.5 and will return this output:

At this point, you can go dive into the filesystem and do any analysis you would like. Remember, we pulled this container image direct from the registry without adding it to the list of images available to podman for deployment.

The other two numeric files provided in the download are a copy of the metadata in text (7b875638cfd87edc473e80774d979a8ddd555e13c6f33db9b712b5d4be244411 in this specific example) and a tarball of any container secrets and the file used to build the container. The following is the output of tar on that file:

=== Other Uses of Skopeo

Skopeo can also do the following things:

  * Copy an image (manifest, filesystem layers, signatures) from one location to another. It can convert between manifest types in doing this (oci, v2s1, v2s2)
  * Delete images from registries that you have admin rights to.
  * Push images to registries that you have push rights to.

Examples of how to do these things are available in 'man skopeo'

=== Cleanup

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
podman kill $(podman ps -q)

podman rm $(podman ps -a -q)
----

== Exit System

.[root@node3 ~]#
----
exit
----


.[root@workstation ~]#
----
uname -n

whoami
----

.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]
----
workstation.example.com

root
----

Now you are ready to proceed to the next unit.
