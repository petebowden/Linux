== Manipulating Files

Since we are working on becoming power users, we should learn how to use several of the most common commands.

If you are coming from a Windows background, you ask yourself, what can't I do with the CLI
that can't be done with a graphical file manager?

Easy, I can automate it.  For example, how could we copy all the HTML files from one directory
to another - but only those that do not exist in the destination directory or are newer than
the versions in the destination directory?

With a file manager, not so easy.  With the CLI?

$ cp -u *.html destination

.Here are the common command-line management commands we will review:
|===
|Command|Syntax|Description
|mkdir|mkdir _directory_|Create a directory
|cp|cp _file new-file_|Copy a file
|cp -r|cp -r _directory new-directory_|Copy a directory and its contents
|mv|mv _file new-file_|Move or rename a file or directory
|rm|rm _file_|Remove a file
|rm -r|rm -r _directory_|Remove a directory containing files
|rmdir|rmdir _directory_|Remove an empty directory

=== Using Wildcards

Prior to getting into the commands, it will be useful to understand wildcards.

The shell uses filenames so much, it provides special characters to help rapidly specify groups of filenames.

These special characters are called _wildcards_.

Using wildcards allows us to select filenames based on patterns.

.Here is a list of wildcards and what they select:
|===
|Wildcard|Matches
|*|Any characters
|?|Any single character
|[_characters_]|Any character that is a member of a set of _characters_
|[!_characters_]|Any character that is not a member of the set of _characters_
|\[[:_class_:]]|Any character that is a member of the specified _class_
|===

.What are the character classes?
|===
|Character Class|Matches
|[:alnum:]|Any alphanumberic character
|[:alpha:]|Any alphabetic character
|[:digit:]|Any numberal
|[:lower:]|Any lowercase letter
|[:uppder:]|Any uppercase letter
|===

.So let's see some wildcard examples we can embed into our commands:
|===
|Pattern|Matches
|*|All files (almost like Windows but, better!)
|h*|Any file beginning with _h_
|c*.dat|Any file beginning with _c_ followed by any characters and ending with _.dat_
|Pete???|Any file beginning with _Pete_ followed by exactly three characters
|[abc]*|Any file beginning with either _a, b, or c_
|/[![:digit:]]*|Any file not beginning with a numeral
|===
