== Navigation and the File System

With our new found knowledge of the shell, let's learn a few things about
navigating the filesystem on Linux.

=== The File System

Linux is organized around files in a _hierarchical directory structure_.

In Windows, we would call this a tree of folders but, on Linux they are referred to as directories.

The top level directory is referred to as the _root directory_.

Linux has a single file system tree and devices such as USB or other drives
are _mounted_ at some place in the directory tree.

On Linux, all files are stored in this file system and organized into a file-system hierarchy.

The _root_ is said to be at the top of the hierarchy and the branches of directories
and subdirectories stretch below the root.  It is therefore, considered and _inverted_ tree.

The / directory is the root directory at the top of the hierarchy.

This is overloaded and the / character is also used as a directory separator
in file names.

The following table lists some of the most important directories in RHEL.

=== Navigation

*Present working directory*

We have already used this command but, let's review it again.

To get the present working directory, we will _print working directory_ using the _pwd_ command:

image:./images/pwd2-command.png[]

This is actually our _HOME_ directory and we know this because the command prompt tells us with the _~_ symbol
as well.

Each user account has it's own _home_ directory which is where we will write most of our files.

*Listing Contents and Changing Directories*

One of the most widely used commands is to list the contents of a directory using the _ls_ command.

Often times we will want to list the contents of a directory or change the current working directory so we are
said to be working with either _absolute_ or _relative_ paths in the tree of directories.

A _path_ of a file or directory specifies its unique file system location.
Following a file path traverses one or more named subdirectories, delimited by a forward slash /, until
the destination is reached.

Directories contain other files and other subdirectories.

Let's test this out by navigating using *pwd* to display the full path of the current working directory.
Then the *ls* command to list the directory contents and the *cd* command to change directories and follow the path.

What just happened here:

. We checked the current working directory
. We listed the contents of the current working directory
. We changed directory to the /Videos directory
. We checked the current working directory
. We listed the contents (nothing)
. We changed directory up one level by using the (..) operation and the down to the /Documents directory
. We listed the contents (nothing)
. We changed directory back to the HOME directory using the (~)

=== Conclusion

In this workshop module, we have:

* Learned about the file and directory hierarchy in Linux
* Learned the basic syntax of navigating the directory hierarchy
