= Workshop Environment Preparation

== Sign-On on to your *workstation* session

Using the connection information and credentials provided by the instructor, get yourselves signed into your workstation session.

== Invoke *tmux* Session

*tmux* is a very handy utilty for terminal session management.  If for any reason you lose connectivity or your session is terminated, *tmux* will preserve your session and allow you to reconnect.  There are MANY other features provided by this utility.  Some of them are listed below in the section titled *tmux*.

.[root@workstation ~]#
----
tmux
----

== Become the root user

In order to execute the environment preparation, we need to become the administrative user 'root'.

.[student@workstation ~]$ 
----
sudo -i
----

== Download the Workshop project from GitHub

.[root@workstation ~]#
----
cd ~
    
git clone https://github.com/xtophd/RHEL8-Workshop
----

== Run the Prep Script

WARNING: It is important to be in the correct working directory for these installation procedures to function properly.  

.[root@workstation ~]#
----
cd ~/RHEL8-Workshop

.[root@workstation RHEL8-Workshop]#
----
bash prepare-rhel8-workshop.sh

The preparation script will run for approximately 5 to 7 minutes.

== How to Cut & Paste with Web Console

NOTE: Chrome is the only "supported" browser that I test for this workshop.  Chances are you will have the same experience with Firefox, but that is not confirmed.

Using Chrome:

  * COPY standard app: CTRL-c
  * PASTE to stardard app: CTRL-v
  * COPY from web-console terminal: CTRL-a + CTRL-c
  * PASTE to web-console terminal: CTRL-a + CTRL-v

== Conclusion

The set up of the RHEL 8 Workshop should now be complete.  A couple of remaining words of advice:

1.  Some exercises are dependant on the successful completion of other exercises.  Those dependencies will be noted.
2.  Pay attention to which user-id (login) to use
3.  Pay attention to which host to use
4.  There is an exam at the conclusion of the workshop... #notreally
